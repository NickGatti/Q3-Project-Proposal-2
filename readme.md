#Back in my day

### A website that tracks the things your parents and grandparents say about 'back in their day'

```
Purpose: One of the many losses of death is information, one thing we can do is ask the old guy...

Ask an old guy what it was like for him in his day, or ask what life was like after world war II

Ask someone who might know what life was like in the 60's

Write what they say down in this website.

We can then see how the times have changed.
